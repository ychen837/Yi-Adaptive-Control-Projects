Consider the system P1(s)=1/(s+0.1)^2 Write a linear parametrization and estimate its parameters from input-output data. Use:
          1. PE input signals (e.g., input = random binary sequence (RBS), summation of several sinusoids, etc.)
          2. Non-PE input signals (e.g., step, one sinusoid).
Try different estimation algorithms and plot the estimation error and the parameter error. Discuss your findings.
(In the interest of expediency, you may use reasonable discretization approximations)

 

Repeat for the system P2(s) = [4s+25]/[s^2 + 6s +25]
