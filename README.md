# Yi-Adaptive-Control-Projects
Adaptive controller implementation and design with plant analysis and identification in MATLAB and Simulink. This project is done under the guidance of Konstantinos Tsakalis in EEE 686.
Controllers including LQG, PPC, MRAC and PID switching are implemented and studied.

## Modules:
1. System Parameter Estimation: Estimates the plant parameter through various input excitation.
2. Controller Design: designs indirect adaptive controllers including LQG and PPC and analyze the plant.
3. Indirect Adaptive Controllers: Designing the controllers to meet specifications.
4. Modifications: methods including dead-zone, projection and sigma modifications to help analyzing the plant and meet specifications.
5. PID switching controller: various PID controllers are designed then the switching algorithm is built for ideal plant output.
6. Bursting Phenomenon: Inducing and studying of the bursting phenomenon in adaptive controllers.
