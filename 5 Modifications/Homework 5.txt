For the systems of HW #4, design and implement

sigma modification
projection modification
dead-zone modification

for the indirect adaptive controllers (LQG, PPC) and direct MRC controllers

Test the adaptive controllers the same reference input, adding a uniform random disturbance at the plant input. 

Compare the results against the response of a well-tuned, fixed controller.
