For the system of HW #2, design and implement indirect adaptive controllers (PID) and use adaptation switching to dynamically select the best one.

Use "random" disturbances at the plant input, changes in the plant parameters, and transmission delays to study the behavior of the adaptive controller under perturbations.

Compare the results against the response of a well-tuned controller, switching at a-priori known times.
