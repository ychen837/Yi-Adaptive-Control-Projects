For the systems of HW #2, design various controllers and analyze their properties.

P1 = 1/(s^2+0.2s+0.01)
P2 = (4s+25)/(s^2+6s+25)

Consider controllers designed to achieve Pole-Placement (PPC), LQ (LQG), and Model-Reference (MRC) objectives.
Tune the controllers such that the closed-loop bandwidth is roughly:

 1(rad/s) for P1(s)
 open-loop bandwidth for P2(s).
For the MRC, choose the reference model as a 1st or 2nd order transfer function with the indicated bandwidth and unity DC gain.

For all controllers, study the magnitude of sensitivity and complementary sensitivity transfer functions.
(Notice that in the MRC case there is significant freedom in the selection of the auxiliary filter.)

Consider controllers with and without integral action.
For each control law (PPC, LQG, MRC) select one design and develop a realization that is suitable
for adaptive control implementation. In particular, for the MRC consider a realization that is suitable for direct adaptive control (control = linear combination of signals).
